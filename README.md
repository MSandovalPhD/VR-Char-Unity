VR Character Animation System in Unity3D
This is just a mock-up of a real-time VR character animation system for Unity3D, optimising animations for gameplay using C#, XR Interaction Toolkit, and 3D math—designed for Meta’s Workrooms-like virtual spaces. Make as many changes as you consider.

Setup in Unity
- Install the XR Interaction Toolkit. In Unity Hub, create a new 3D project (2021.3 LTS or later), install the XR Interaction Toolkit via the Package Manager, and set up Oculus Integration for Meta Quest compatibility.
- Add a humanoid character model (e.g., from Unity Asset Store) with animations (Idle, Walk, Wave) and an Animator Controller.
- Set up a VR scene with a player rig (e.g., XR Origin), hands (e.g., XRDirectInteractor), and link to the scripts above.
